The project revolves around the creation of an ecommerce platform tailored specifically for the agriculture sector, addressing the needs of farmers and industrialists. The platform aims to empower farmers by providing a direct avenue to sell their produce to industrial buyers, thereby eliminating intermediaries and boosting their profits. Moreover, the website offers a dedicated section for farmers to procure fertilizers at reduced costs, enhancing their agricultural endeavors.

One of the prominent challenges faced by the agricultural industry is the identification of plant diseases. To tackle this issue, advanced machine learning technologies, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and the ResNet16 model, have been integrated into the system. These technologies facilitate accurate and efficient disease detection in plants. The platform not only identifies diseases but also suggests appropriate preventive measures to curtail disease spread. Additionally, the system provides recommendations for suitable fertilizers that can aid in disease prevention and management.

In summary, the project's ecommerce website offers a specialized platform for farmers to directly sell their products to industrial buyers, eliminating middlemen and enhancing profitability. The inclusion of machine learning technology allows for effective plant disease detection, accompanied by actionable recommendations for disease control and the optimal use of fertilizers. This comprehensive approach addresses key challenges in the agriculture sector while fostering economic growth for farmers and the industry alike.
